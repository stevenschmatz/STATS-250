# Lecture 2: Distribution and Visualization of Data

## Summaries of Data

When describing data, *numerical summaries* and *graphical summaries* can be performed.

#### Common Numerical Summaries
* Frequency (i.e., count)
* Relative frequency (i.e., percentage from 0 to 1)
* Extrema (i.e., smallest/largest values)
* Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and many more

#### Common Graphical Summaries
Note that for plotting quantitative data, the data can be segmented into regions \\([a, b)\\) where \\(a\\) is included in the region and \\(b\\) is not included in the region.

* Histogram (i.e., bar chart)
    * For categorical data, the order of categories does not matter
    * Make sure to include a data table
* Pie chart
    * Not as easy to compare sizes of categories, especially with a large number of them

## Describing Distribution of Data
*Distribution* of data comprises of the **values** a variable can take, and the **proportion** of time the variable takes those values.

A histogram tells us:
* **Overall pattern**
    * Is it symmetric? Skewed? Bell-shaped? Uniform?
        * Skewed right has most of the data on the **left**, and vice versa
    * The *modality* (how many peaks does the data have?)
* **Location of (center, average)**
    * 50% point or balance point
* **Variability**
    * Range (max - min)
    * Standard deviation
    * Variance
* **Deviations (unusual features)**
    * Outliers
    * Should not be discarded without justification
