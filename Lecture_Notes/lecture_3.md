# Lecture 3: Numerical Summaries

 Notation for describing a set of data:
 
 $$x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n$$
 
 where \\(n\\) is the size of your data set.
 
 #### Describing the Center Location
 
 ##### Mean
 
Mean of the data set: the average of all elements.

$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \dots + x_n}{n}$$

The mean is *sensitive* to extreme observations.

##### Median

Median of the data set: the middle element, when *the elements are sorted in increasing order!*

The median is *resistant* (robust) to extreme observations.
